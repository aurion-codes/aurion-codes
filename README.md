Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aurion (she/her)-A Cloud Engineer and life-long learner

Being a naturally curious and forward thinking individual has led me to the world of technology. I love solving complex problems for fun. Challenging myself is a technique I use to grow and develop. 

My current skills in which I am continuously improving:

Front-end technologies - JavaScript, React, Styled Components,HTML5 and CSS

Back-end technologies - Ruby, Ruby on Rails, json
Databases- PostgresQL, SQLite and SQL

Since completing a Fullstack Immersive Software Engineering program, I've taken advantage of learning by doing/working on projects, blogging to help others and expand upon my current skills. I'm excited to continually learn and be a life-long learner of innovative technologies. 

ðŸŒ± I enjoy staying up-to-date with technolgies. I am currently learning about cloud computing.

<!-- Fun Facts:
